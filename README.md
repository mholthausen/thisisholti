# TypeScript Starter

Welcome to the TypeScript Starter project! This repository serves as a foundational template for kickstarting your TypeScript, React, and Vite-based web application development.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have the following software installed on your system:

1. **Node.js**: You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **npm** (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js installation.

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can proceed to set up and run the application.
